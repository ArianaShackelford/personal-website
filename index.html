        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Ariana and I am a Full Stack Developer. My professional interest lean towards Front End and Mobile Development, though I have a life long curiosity streak that keeps me interested in learning how to do at least a little bit of everything. This extends to my personal interests as well, it would take too long to list all my hobbies because they are constantly changing and the list is ever growing. My husband and I recently bought a 121 year old house so when I am not working I am fixing it up and gardening. I have a plethora of plants and could talk for hours about them, we are also going to be welcoming home three little kittens in the next couple of weeks and I am very excited to have some furry companions.</p>
